I can not believe its almost two years since I posted my last post here... Time flies.

### Why Stop and Why Restart ?

The reason why I stopped is ... I am too lazy and writing is a very hard habit to form... and also:

1. The more I know, the harder for me to write anything. I am always thinking too much
2. I love creating tools instead of documents, like posts
3. There are so many things happened to me in the past 2 years

So, why restart ?

1. I feel I need something help me organize my own knowledge and thoughts
2. Though its hard to form the habit, its a very great habit to have
3. I need a place to store my memories
4. I want to improve my writings, someday, i want to even write a book, about myself, my life and my family
5. I don't want to let my blog stay there and collect dust... 

### What's the Plan ?

Here is the goal, I am trying my best to make it trackable and measurable:

1. at least two posts every week;
2. content will focus on my own thoughts after reading or random thoughts, and everything about web technology
3. the UI of the blog will be updated sooner or later, functionalities maybe removed and added: Surprise!
4. the comments section will be soon re-enabled

### Serverless

YES. Since the blog hosted on Github, and created with hexo, so it will be serverless all the time.

With the help of AWS Lambda, Serverless won't be a problem any more, lets explore the new world!

### See You Soon

I will post another one today to give you a brief introduction about myself and my life for past two years.
