## Before 2016

I believe a person can only find himself/herself from various experiences. Its like, a person can not know whether he likes apple or not until he tried it.

In China, almost every kid has the same path before 20: they enjoyed the childhood until six or seven, learned some basic stuff from kindergarten, and then they went to elementary school, middle school, high school and finally, most of them will go to a different city, or even a different country, to pursue a higher education: either college or university.

And their lives start, and they will follow different paths, the first time in their lives.

I went to the top university in China, at age 17, before that, I was one of millions.

After graduated, I believe I found what I love and want, that starts the second stage of my life: Work, Travel and Study.

1. I graduated at 2013
2. I joined SoGou, Inc and stayed there for 1 year, from 2013 to 2014
3. I quit the job and went to the PRA (army) for a two-month training (to lose weight) (from 2014/8 to 2014/10)
4. I went to New Zealand with Working Holiday Visa, enjoyed myself as a freelancer for half of a year (from 2014/12 to 2015/5)
5. I came back home and stayed with my parents for two months
6. I came to USA to pursue a Computer Science master degree in Cornell (from 2015/8 to 2016/5)

That should give you a very brief introduction about myself, my life. Now lets focus on what happened after 2016.

## 2016 to 2018

Work and Places:

1. I graduated from Cornell, left Ithaca and the east coast (from 2015/8 to 2016/5)

4. I moved from CA to Seattle, WA, and joined Amazon as SDE II (from 2017/10)

Life:

1. I broke up with one of my best friend (2016/4)
2. I made several new friends (2016 to now)
3. I am in a relationship with a girl I love

5. I had my first pet, a cat, youtiao!
6. My gf got accepted into several universities and she chose UW@Seattle at the end, so she will come here in August

9. I finished ~100 books: detective novels, essays, travel novels, fictions, tech books, etc
10. I start going to gym almost every weekday (2018/1)

I love and I am satisfied with my life now, I will keep going and always follow my heart.

### After 2018

I don't really have a solid plan for next a few years, time changes, people change.

And I am very open to any changes.

The only thing that won't change is: I will always follow my heart.
