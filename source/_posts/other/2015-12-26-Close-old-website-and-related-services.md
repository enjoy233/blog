**Hi all:**

  Since I have one month winter break, so I decide to rebuild some old projects with some fancy stuff. And also to save some money, I just closed the server that supported them for nearly two years... I am sad and sorry if that causes any trouble... I have sent an email to all the active users about this ... Thanks for your understanding.

  The major influence would be caused by the shutdown of feedpusher and wordcard since they have most users... Truly sorry about that. I will try my best to build a new and better one in this month, look forward to it!! :)

  The ipromise would be fine since they are just a plain web application without any need for server things, actually I host it on the github, so please continue using it :)

  All the updates about my new feedpusher would be pushed to the github repo: [feedpusher](https://github.com/taoalpha/feedpusher), any issues you have or features you want, just open an issue under this repo :)

  Same for wordcard, I will recover it in next week, maybe will remove the user authentication and use plain web application. :)

  And also I will keep updating my first CLI nodejs app: [baby](https://github.com/taoalpha/baby), feel free to use it and give me any suggestions you have.

  Seem I have a very busy break :)

  Have a wonderful new year!!!
