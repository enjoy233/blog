### 88 Days till Graduation

I believe this will be my last 88 days being a student in a university :) I will never come back to school... based on following reasons:

1. Too expensive. Even I want to start my own start-up, I will not consider pursuing a MBA in USA ...
2. Not sure what the school can give me. As a full stack engineer and focus on web dev(at least trying to be), 60%-80% of the knowledge/skills was learned by myself. I used to study in the top university in China for 4 years, and just like what steve jobs said in Stanford Commencement, 2005: I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. But I didn't have the courage to drop out, and in order to have a good background to find a job in USA and do what I love, I came to USA, I have to say that I have learned a lot in the past year, but no more than what I have learned through the several internship and full-time work experience ...
3. Life is precious, time is priceless. I don't know how long I can live, but I hope I can do what I love all the time till I die. School days are so lazy and easy to waste a lot of time on some useless things...


### 138 Days till My first day

I accepted the offer from one start-up I interviewed with. I think they are pretty cool and perfect for me:

1. They are early-age start-up, so I can learn a lot including how to start a start-up and how to overcome those obstacles that early-age start-up meets all the time;
2. Founders and co-founders are former Googlers, so I definitely can learn a lot from them;
3. The senior front end engineer is so damn cool and he definitely will be a super cool mentor from whom I can learn all the basic and advance skills about web;
4. They focus on the big data and machine learning which are the hottest things in current world;
5. Nice package and benefits, great location (palo alto) with tons of opportunities;

And based on all these good aspects,  I withdrawed my interviews with Google :) And I am pretty sure I can not get the offer based on what I know and what I am capable of.

### How to use the rest 138 days
